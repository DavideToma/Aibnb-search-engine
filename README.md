## Assignment
The homework consists in analyzing the text of Airbnb property listings and building a search engine.

## What you will find in our repository:
1) `Homework_3.ipynb`: a tidy Notebook where we put the code and the comments of our pipeline.
2) `data/citycoord.pkl`: in this file you will find all the coordinates of the city centers we used to compute our ranking score in the step 4; we save this information in a file, since that block of code can be very slow, expecially with a low connection. For this reason, we saved a copy of the data retrived and executed just once.
3) `data/invertedindex.pkl`: this file contain the inverted index calculated in the step 3.
4) `data/map.html` : the map in html format because of on github it is impossible to show it.
